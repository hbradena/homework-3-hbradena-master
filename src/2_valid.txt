Consider these propositional atoms:

p: It is cold
q: I build a snowman
r: It snows
s: I go sledding

In each part:

    a) Translate each premise and the conclusion to English using the propositional atoms above.
    b) If the argument is valid, write "valid" and a sentence explaining how you could prove the validity
        of the argument (you do not need to do the proof -- just explain what you would need to do).
        If the argument is NOT valid, write "not valid" and include a truth assignment that is a counterexample.
        (You do not need to complete a full truth table.)

Part 1 (complete steps (a) and (b):

    Premise: p → q
    Conclusion: q → p

a) Translate each premise and the conclusion to English using the propositional atoms above.

Premise: If it is cold, I will build a snowman.
Conclusion: If I build I snowman, it is cold.


b) If the argument is valid, write "valid" and a sentence explaining how you could prove the validity of the argument.
    If the argument is NOT valid, write "not valid" and include a truth assignment that is a counterexample.

Not valid.
p: F
q: T

This truth assignment makes the premise true and the conclusion false.



//////////////

Part 2 (complete steps (a) and (b):

    Premises: (p ∨ q) → r, ¬q, ¬r
    Conclusion: ¬p


a) Translate each premise and the conclusion to English using the propositional atoms above.

Premises: If it is cold or I build a snowman, it snows.
          I do not build a snowman.
          It does not snow.

Conclusion: It is not cold.


b) If the argument is valid, write "valid" and a sentence explaining how you could prove the validity of the argument.
       If the argument is NOT valid, write "not valid" and include a truth assignment that is a counterexample.


Valid. In order for it to be invalid, there has to be at least one truth assignment
    where all the premises are true but the conclusion is false. In this example, there are no
    such truth assignments. The only way to make the premises true is for all 3 variables to
    be false. This means p is false making the conclusion true.


//////////////

Part 3 (complete steps (a) and (b):

    Premises: ¬(q ∧ s), p → s, r → q
    Conclusion: ¬r ∧ ¬s


a) Translate each premise and the conclusion to English using the propositional atoms above.

    Premises: I didn't build a snowman and I didn't go sledding.
              If it is cold, then I go sledding.
              If it is snowing, I will build a snowman.
    Conclusion: It did not snow, and I did not go sledding.

b) If the argument is valid, write "valid" and a sentence explaining how you could prove the validity of the argument.
          If the argument is NOT valid, write "not valid" and include a truth assignment that is a counterexample.

Not valid.
p: T
q: F
r: F
s: T


This truth assignment makes all the premises true and the conclusion false.
