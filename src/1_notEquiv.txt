Prove that the statements:

    p ∧ q → r

and

    (p → r) ∧ (q → r)

are NOT logically equivalent.

Afterward, explain why you have shown that the two statements are not equivalent.
What would you expect to happen differently if both statements were equivalent?

p: T
q: F
r: F

When this truth assignment is used, the left half of the first statement becomes false which
    makes the whole statement TRUE when r is false. On the second statement, the left half
    becomes false and the right half is true. This makes the whole second statement FALSE.
    Because there is a truth assignment that produces different answers from both statements,
    the statements are NOT logically equivalent.

If both statements were equivalent, then there could not be a truth assignment that makes the
    statements produce a different answer. In other words, every truth assignment would
    produce the same answer from both statement if the statements were equivalent.
